# this project

- Type words for a minute to see how you perform
- All letters are more or less equally used


- Vocabulary is planned to be changed
- There is no decision yet on giving conventional wpm/cpm characteristics

## motivation

The site I used to use finally annoyed me into writing my own simplified version.

## state

- Usable
- Frontend: works as I need it
- Words: quickly filtered `10k.txt` file. I will probably replace it with 5+ letter words from 30k file after slower filtering.

## plan

1. took words from: https://github.com/derekchuank/high-frequency-vocabulary/
2. extracted a subset to cover letters with more equal frequency
3. made the frontend
4. pushed it to github pages
5. looked into opportunities for errors/speed statistics per key using local storage
