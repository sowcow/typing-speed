# Typing Speed

- Naming is hard
- Type words for a minute to see how you perform
- All letters have more or less equal frequency of appearance
- It doesn't give you conventional WPM (one word at a time + average word length is different)

## Possibilities for Change

1. Vocabulary is planned to be changed
1. Per key stats are unlikely but who knows
1. No idea yet about replacing one word at a time mechanics with a continuous line (probably requires replacing "particles")
1. There is no decision yet on giving conventional wpm/cpm characteristics (requires continuous line)

## Motivation

The site I used to use finally annoyed me into writing my own simplified version.

## State

- Ready
- Frontend: works as I need it
- Words: quickly filtered `10k.txt` file. I will probably replace it with 5+ letter words from 30k file after slower filtering.

## Plan

1. took words from: https://github.com/derekchuank/high-frequency-vocabulary/
2. extracted a subset to cover letters with more equal frequency
3. made the frontend
4. pushed it to github pages
5. looked into opportunities for errors/speed statistics per key using local storage
