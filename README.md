# this project

Type words for a minute and see your typing characteristics.

## motivation

The site I used to use finally annoyed me into writing my own simplified version.

## plan

1. took words from: https://github.com/derekchuank/high-frequency-vocabulary/
2. extracted a subset to cover letters with more equal frequency
3. made the frontend
4. pushed it to git pages
5. looked into opportunities for errors/speed statistics per key using local storage
